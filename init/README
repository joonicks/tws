Read INSTALL for notes on installing twsinit.

Currently these files are recognized;

==> /etc/init/auto

This is the default command to run to get the system up and
running. Most likely a shellscript. On systems with two or more
different startup scripts (ie, /etc/rc.d/rc.S + /etc/rc.d/rc.M)
you need to write a wrapper that calls them both in order.

Ex:
	echo '/etc/init/rc.Sysup rc.Sysup' > /etc/init/auto

==> /etc/init/spawn

Contains filenames with services to start/respawn. Filename is
relative to `/etc/init/'. Thus a filename of `tty1' would instruct
twsinit to run and respawn, as needed, the command contained in
the file `/etc/init/tty1'.

DO NOT USE THIS TO START SERVICES THAT BACKGROUND THEMSELVES!
(see BUGS for an explanation why...)

Ex:
	echo 'tty1 tty2' > /etc/init/spawn
	echo '/sbin/agetty /sbin/agetty 38400 tty1 linux' > /etc/init/tty1
	echo '/sbin/agetty /sbin/agetty 38400 tty2 linux' > /etc/init/tty2

==> /etc/init/term

Contains the command to run when twsinit receives SIGTERM.
The shutdown capabilities are still not complete, but it should work
sufficiently well for simple production use.

twsinit will not resume normal operation after receiving SIGTERM,
it expects the shutdown script to work without any errors, effectively
shutting down or rebooting the system.

Ex:
	echo '/etc/init/rc.Shutdown rc.Shutdown' > /etc/init/term

==> /etc/init/hostname

twsinit will call sethostname(2) with the content of this file
(if it exists).

Ex:
	echo 'darkstar' > /etc/init/hostname

==> /etc/init/domainname
twsinit will call setdomainname(2) with the content of this file
(if it exists).

Ex:
	echo 'frop.org' > /etc/init/domainname

And thats all you can configure for now.
