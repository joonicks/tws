To make the `production' binary;

	make strip

The binary should be compatible with any Linux 2.x, ix86 system.

Make sure you have some alternate way of booting before installing
twsinit as your default.

DO NOT MIX SYSVINIT TOOLS AND TWSINIT TOOLS!

Running the `shutdown' program from sysvinit tools will
most likely cause your box to lock up.

Running `reboot -f' seems to be safe, but using other arguments
are NOT!
